If you’re the type of person that would join this Discord, you probably have some guesses as to how those rewards are possible and sustainable — and you might even have a sense for what’s really going on here.\n> \n> All throughout the Eco-system (\uD83D\uDE09), people are earning Eco Points. They don't do much today. We affectionately say that they're \"for research purposes only.\"\n> \n> But the reality is, these Points are what will enable the whole system. They're what align everyone's interests: your interests, our interests, the interests of everyone using the Eco App, and more.\n> \n> How? Imagine a world where Amex executives got paid in Amex points, or Chase employees in Chase points. A world where those companies' vendors got paid in points. A world where, perhaps, that points economy became divorced from the fiat economy. What would that look like?\n> \n> It'd be a fun experiment. But we figure that a centralized system where Amex and Chase could print more points (or take them out of people's accounts) would fail. Those centralization risks don't create the circumstances for a new, thriving economy.\n> \n> It might just turn out that Eco is trying to take that idea to its inevitable, successful conclusion. But, as always: you need to blow people’s minds one step at a time. \n> \n> Perhaps you can start to put the pieces together. \n> \n> We'll be sharing more soon, but you're more than welcome to theorize here in the meantime ➡️ #\uD83E\uDDEEeco-nomics||",
