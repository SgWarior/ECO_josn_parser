      "content": "***Crypto’s “Holy Grail”***\n\nThe industry has been waiting 10 years for something that allows everyday users to participate in and benefit from crypto. Many have tried, but we always end up with just another wallet or app that requires stored seed phrases and forces people into unintuitive flows and exposure to risk.  If the masses are going to come, they’ll need a bridge to get here. Hence: the Eco App. \uD83C\uDF09\n\nThe Eco App keeps the parts of the old system that worked and rebuilt from the ground up the parts that didn't. That’s how we’re able to offer high APY (2.5-5%) and cashback rewards (5% at Amazon, Uber, etc.) — orders of magnitude better than our competitors. But now, we need to get it in everyone’s hands...\uD83E\uDD33\n\nThat’s where you come in.\n\n***Layer Up***\n\nOur beta testing focused on 1:1 onboarding calls with users from all walks of life. Now, our most important task is onboarding the world to the Eco App.\n \n***Ready Layer 1***\n\nThe more people you onboard to this new paradigm, the more you’ll be rewarded. And as we all know: *it pays to be early*.\n\nPlus: the App is only getting better. We’re working on offering the ability to pay your largest bills from the App, spend anywhere, make peer-to-peer payments, and more. And with each action, users get rewarded with Eco Points. ✨\n\nAnd yes: we’re all winning together. \uD83C\uDFC6 You win when you onboard them, they win when they use the product — and as you’ve seen in this space, when everyone is on the same team… big things happen. \n\n***Get Started***\n\nWe're starting small and only opening this program to a very limited group of motivated community members who are ready to work closely with us, give lots of feedback and grow together. If you think that's you:\n\n\uD83D\uDCA5DM @Dave | Eco or grab some time on his calendar below \uD83D\uDC47   to set up a quick 1:1. We’ll go over incentive details, onboarding best practices, and any questions you have! \uD83D\uDCA5 \n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 **No Calendar Spots Currently Available** \uD83D\uDEA8",
