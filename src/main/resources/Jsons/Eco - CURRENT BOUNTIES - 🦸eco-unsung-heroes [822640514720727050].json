      "content": ":eco:  Every week at Eco we hold an ‘*all hands*’ meetings where the whole team gathers to discuss the highlights of the week, projects we're working on and upcoming developments. \n\nAn important part of these meetings is naming Eco’s “*Unsung Hero*”. \n\nEach week, our CEO Andy identifies a team member and highlights something that they've done over the past 7 days which may have initially been overlooked but which goes above and beyond the call of duty and is worth drawing attention to. \n\nWe thought it would be a good idea to do something similar here in our Eco community in order to recognize the incredible effort and support we’ve received from our amazing community members! With so much activity going on every single day in our Discord server want to make sure to call out contributions that deserve to be highlighted and celebrated.\n\nSo, each week we will nominate 5 “***Unsung Hero***” candidates from Eco community and highlight the things they did to help the *E-community* through their leadership, creativity or technical skills. \n\nEveryone will then have 5 days to vote and choose the person they feel is most deserving of the Eco “***Unsung Hero***” title. The Eco team will choose 1 winner as well.\n\nNominees will be announced on Mondays mornings and voting will run until Friday at 5pm EST.\n\nAs always, thank you so much to all the amazing *Ecolytes* in this *Eco-mmunity*. We are constantly humbled by the incredible group of people that have chosen to share this journey with us! :eco_heart:\n\nWe would also like to give a special shoutout to @Crypto for being the first to propose this idea to the Eco Team!",

Creator of the now universally adopted :points: Points emoji (among many others) Anjin_San has perhaps done more than any other member to help develop the aesthetic of the Eco Discord Server through their quality artistic contributions! Beyond that, Anjin_San is a highly active community member both in the #\uD83D\uDE80general  and language specific channels!\n\n\uD83D\uDFE8 @parallacs \nYou can’t scroll through any channel in the Eco Discord server for more than a second or two without finding a contribution from parallacs. Present everywhere, always helpful and full of good ideas (they gave us the idea for the #\uD83D\uDD0Ehistory-submissions  channel) parallacs has been a key contributor to the *Eco-mmunity* since day 1.\n\n\uD83D\uDFE5 @Crypto \nEco’s unofficial “welcoming party,” community guide and the very reason that the #\uD83E\uDDB8eco-unsung-heroes  program exists, Crypto has played an important role in building the positive, informed and engaged community that Eco is blessed with today. \n\n\uD83D\uDFE6 @Redallica \nA core contributor in both the language and developer channels, Redallica is everywhere! Positive, helpful and incredibly keen to help build the *Eco-mmunity*, Redallica (among many other things) also led the creation of the French Eco Website!",

This act of selflessness and community spirit is one of the coolest things we’ve seen since launching our Discord!\n\n\uD83D\uDFE8 @chebykin  as been an active and supportive member of the *Eco-mmunity* since Day 1. Not only that, they have taken the :eco:  message to their community in a ‘larger than life’ way by personally putting up Eco billboards in their hometown! **Incredible.** \n\n\uD83D\uDFE5 @IgreX  - In addition to providing thoughtful insights in the #\uD83E\uDDEEeco-nomics  channels and being an active participant in the #\uD83C\uDDF7\uD83C\uDDFAru-eco community, IgreX takes things to the next level with their amazing memes and bounty submissions!\n\n\uD83D\uDFE6 @Rawan  has provided some incredible insights and kept us on top of current trends and events like nobody else in the *Eco-mmunity*! From #\uD83D\uDE80general  to #\uD83E\uDDEEeco-nomics  to #\uD83D\uDCC8crypto-chat  @Rawan  is ever present with thoughtful comments or the latest food for though from the crypto world!\n\n**Please note:** In order to cast a vote, users need the “Voter” role. If you don't have it simply DM any member of the Eco Team. Thank you all for your participation.",

We’d be lost without them!\n\n\uD83D\uDFE5 @Modestolich  and @rdfbbx  are names that perhaps you don’t hear about quite as often in the #\uD83D\uDE80general  channel, but if you’ve been in the :eco:  Discord for more than 10 minutes, you definitely know their work! They are our tireless engineers and are responsible for the awesome custom #\uD83C\uDFB0lotteries  and voting BOTS that our community uses everyday! The Eco Discord would be so much less interesting if we didn’t have the amazing tools they so generously built for us!",
