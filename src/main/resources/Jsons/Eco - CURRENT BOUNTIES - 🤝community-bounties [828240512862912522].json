So that is where this bounty stems from.\nMy idea about bounty ECONOVATION (possibly it can take more than a week, who knows):\nTo create any physical self-moving and handmade pilot model (prototype of ANY kind of vehicle in miniature) decorated in Eco-style. \nPossible ideas of ECONOVATIONcould be following but not limited to these: \n•    In terms of models it could be car-types, boats, balloons, submarines, planes, robots, any form etc…\n•    In terms of propulsion could include any kind of ever known to humankind: steam, electrical engine, heated air, gasoline, water jet, sail, rubber engine, Arduino, coolers for PC motherboard etc.\nParticipants should:\n1.    Make video presentation of the model and its functionality decorated with Eco-style.\n2.    Possibly include in video details of model production\n3.    Could be with remote-controlled or without any.\nOther conditions: \n•    Safety – it should not be dangerous in any kind to any living being or property.\n•    Fabricated 3d party ready drones or robots are excluded but could be included if modified or used in combination.\nExample: https://ok.ru/video/1277277767135\nAssessment: 1.
